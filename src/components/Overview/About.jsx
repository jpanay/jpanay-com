        <p>Hey I'm Jason, welcome to my site!</p>
        <p>
          As a lifelong coder, I've honed my skills over the past four years
          doing full-stack development for various start-ups and companies in my
          hometown of NYC and across the US.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding or falling down the YouTube rabbit hole, I like to
          spend my time rock climbing, exploring the city, and learning new
          skills.
