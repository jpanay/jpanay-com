        <p>Hey I'm Jason, welcome to my site!</p>
        <p>
          I'm a lifelong coder who has spent the past 4 years doing full stack
          development for various start-ups and companies throughout the US.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding or falling down the YouTube rabbit hole I like to
          spend my time rock climbing, exploring the city, and making new
          connections.
        </p>
