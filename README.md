# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Personal Site Plans

Pages: Overview and Resources
Overview: Header (headshot, name, title, and location), about, experience, projects, and skill stack
Resources: My favorite resources for getting started in development, upskilling, job hunting, and personal site inspiration
Styling: Use Tailwind with preset for the main color scheme at jpanay.github.io and FontWwesome for icons

Ideas: Customizable Jason where you can change his outfit and accessories, interactive background with three.js, certifications section, j.panay() logo with typing animation, button to expand and collapse all skills, key values/principals section, paint brush stroke on mouse move, headshot shadow interaction with mouse position, fill out resources page, stack/description of how this personal site was built, make overview section headers sticky, add descriptions for experience items, add lateprint to projects

Color Schema:
Green #76FA93
Blue #76C1FF
Yellow #FFFD7E
Purple #AA33EE
