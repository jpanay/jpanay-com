# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Personal Site Plans

Pages: Overview and Resources
Overview: Header (headshot, name, title, and location), about, experience, projects, and skill stack
Resources: My favorite resources for getting started in development, upskilling, job hunting, and personal site inspiration
Styling: Use Tailwind with preset for the main color scheme at jpanay.github.io and FontWwesome for icons

Ideas: Customizable Jason where you can change his outfit and accessories, interactive background with three.js, certifications section, j.panay() logo with typing animation, key values/principals section, paint brush stroke on mouse move, headshot shadow interaction with mouse position, fill out resources page, stack/description of how this personal site was built, make overview section headers sticky, add descriptions for experience items, add lateprint to projects, improve nav accessibility, improve styling best practices by moving max-w up to a higher component, fix subnav not highlighting technical proficiencies after navigating to that section while it's expanded.

Color Schema:
Green #76FA93
Blue #76C1FF
Yellow #FFFD7E
Purple #AA33EE
